FOR (guess 1 thru 3):

    PRINT "Guess a number between 1 & 10"
    Get user input from keyboard
    Store in variable 'userInput'

    IF 'userInput' equals 'secretNumber':
        PRINT "You win!"
        EXIT program
    ELSE:
        PRINT "Nope try again"
    END IF

END FOR

// If code reaches this point, then the loop has executed 3 times
// without a correct guess, ie. the user has expended 3 guesses.

PRINT "You lose!"
END
